I'm a Software Engineer passionate about building scalable, event-driven systems that power modern applications. With over 5 years of experience in web development, I specialize in TypeScript, React, Go, Python, and AWS cloud services.

Currently, I'm architecting a robust chat system using event-driven patterns and AWS cloud services. My expertise spans from frontend frameworks to backend microservices, with a particular interest in distributed systems and cloud-native architectures.

I'm actively learning best practices for building systems that can handle high loads, optimizing database performance, and ensuring seamless scalability. My curiosity extends to AI agents and their potential to transform how we approach complex development challenges.

When I'm not coding, you'll find me contributing to open source projects, exploring new technologies, or sharing insights about scalable architecture and modern development practices.
